Shopify GraphQL responses require numerous defensive checks before safely accessing properties. These include checking that the data, operation and resources are defined, and checking that there are no user errors.

<details>

<summary>With these checks in place, your code might look like this (expand)...</summary>

```ts
const response = await admin.graphql(CREATE_PRODUCT_MUTATION);

const json = await response.json();

if (!json.data) {
  throw new Error("No data returned in response.");
}

if (!json.data.productCreate) {
  throw new Error("No operation returned in response.");
}

if (0 < json.data.productCreate.userErrors.length) {
  throw new Error("User errors returned in response.");
}

if (!json.data.productCreate.product) {
  throw new Error("No resource returned in response.");
}

// Phew, we finally have a safe product to use.
const product = json.data.productCreate.product;
```

</details>

With `@storeforge/unwrap`, you can safely unwrap GraphQL responses in a fully type-safe way, with minimal boilerplate.

```ts
import { unwrap } from "@storeforge/unwrap";

const product = await unwrap(
  await admin.graphql(CREATE_PRODUCT_MUTATION),
  "productCreate", // Operation
  "product", // Resource
);

// Guaranteed to exist.
const productTitle = product.title;
```

## Features

- ü™∂ Zero dependencies
- üì¶ Tiny package size (~7kb)
- ‚úîÔ∏è Works with all Shopify GraphQL clients
- üß© TypeScript types inferred from responses
- ü™É Throws an error if the response contains user errors
- ü™É Throws an error if any of the expected data is missing

## Install

```
npm install @storeforgedev/unwrap
```

## Usage

To safely unwrap the response, wrap the GraphQL response with the `unwrap` method.

```ts
import { unwrap } from "@storeforge/unwrap";

const product = await unwrap(
  await admin.graphql(CREATE_PRODUCT_MUTATION),
  "productCreate",
  "product",
);
```

If you want to access the entire operation, omit the last parameter. Note that the operation will not contain `userErrors`, since this is implicitly handled for you within the `unwrap` method.

```ts
import { unwrap } from "@storeforge/unwrap";

const productCreate = await unwrap(
  await admin.graphql(CREATE_PRODUCT_MUTATION),
  "productCreate",
);
```

If you want to access the entire data object, omit both parameters. In this format, you need to check for `userErrors` yourself.

```ts
import { unwrap } from "@storeforge/unwrap";

const data = await unwrap(await admin.graphql(CREATE_PRODUCT_MUTATION));
```

## User errors

When the GraphQL operation contains `userErrors` or `customerUserErrors`, a `UserErrorsException` error will be thrown. This means you don't need to worry about checking for user errors in your own code, although you should ideally catch them.

```ts
import { unwrap, UserErrorsException } from "@storeforge/unwrap";

try {
  const productCreate = await unwrap(
    await admin.graphql(CREATE_PRODUCT_MUTATION),
    "productCreate",
  );
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof UserErrorsException) {
    /**
     * You can access a simple array of error strings using the
     * formattedUserErrors accessor.
     */
    return { errors: e.formattedUserErrors };

    /**
     * Alternatively, you can access the raw user errors, which may
     * have an inconsistent shape depending on the mutation.
     */
    return { errors: e.userErrors };
  }

  throw e;
}
```
